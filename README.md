# ðŸ’° Loan Prediction using Random Forest and XGBoost

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan will be approved based on customer demographic and financial data.  
The dataset includes features such as credit score, income, loan amount, tenure, and previous credit history.  
The model is deployed with **Streamlit** for interactive predictions.

## Live Demo
The application can be accessed here: [Loan Prediction App](https://2702265641tiffannyfelita.streamlit.app/)  
>  Note: The app may take some time to load if inactive, as Streamlit apps hosted for free may go to sleep. I might need to "wake up" the app by opening the link.

## Model Performance
Two machine learning models were compared:
- **Random Forest:** Achieved **90.71% accuracy**, meaning approximately 91 out of 100 predictions were correct.  
- **XGBoost:** Achieved **92.72% accuracy**, meaning approximately 93 out of 100 predictions were correct. 

>  Comparing both models, **XGBoost** generally outperforms Random Forest in accuracy and predictive reliability, making it suitable for real-world loan approval prediction.
